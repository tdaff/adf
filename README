adf.py
======

Calculate spatial distributions of atom types by angle.


Two flavours:

 * adf.py
      Spatially decomposed to single reference direction and 
      averaged over all atoms.

 * adf-bonds.py
      Referenced to symmetry directions (derived with bondseek.py)
      and deviation averaged over all atoms.

      First run bondseek.py to generate the bonding directions from 
      the first step of the HISTORY file. Input file takes the 
      following options:
      
       * input_file_name: HISTORY
       * output_prefix: references
       * reference: Zn
       * seek_atom: N
       * cutoff: 2.5

      The output is a 'references_Zn_N.py' file imported by adf-bonds.py.
      The options for adf-bonds.py are:

       * input_file_name: HISTORY
       * output_prefix: adf
       * datafile: references_Zn_N
       * seek_atom: Cx
       * angle_bins: 90
       * cutoff: 10.0
