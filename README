adf.py
======

Calculate spatial distributions of atom types by angle.


Two flavours:

   adf.py
      spatially decomposed to single reference direction and 
      averaged over all atoms

   adf-bonds.py
      referenced to symmetry directions (derived with bondseek.py)
      and deviation averaged over all atoms
